Exercise 1: Look up
-------------------

Consider we would like to look up shopping prices.
In this chapter, we will use a **dictionary**,
a data structure that is good for looking up items.

Execute the following code:

.. code:: python3

   prices = {
      "apple": 0.50,
      "banana": 1.00,
      "orange": 1.50,
      "cherries": 3.00,
   }
   print(prices["banana"])

How does the dictionary differ from a list?


Exercise 2: Explore
-------------------

Find out what each of the expressions does to the dictionary in the center.

Exercise 3: Look up
-------------------

Now consider having the list of items in ``fruit``.
You would like to calculate the total price.
For that, the list and dictionary need to work together.

Sort the lines and indent them properly:

   print(total)
   total += prices[item]
   bought = ["banana", "banana", "cherries", "apple", "apple", "banana"]
   for item in bought:
   total = 0
   prices = {
      "apple": 0.50,
      "banana": 1.00,
      "orange": 1.50,
      "cherries": 3.00,
   }

Exercise 4: Receipt assitant 2.0
--------------------------------

Improve the receipt assistant from the previous chapter
so that it uses a dictionary of prices.


Exercise 5: Traveler
--------------------

The following program allows you to travel from one city to the next.
Unfortunately, it contains **five bugs**. Find and fix them.

.. code:: python3

   cities = {
       "New York": ["Tokyo", "Delhi", "London"],
       "Poznan": ["London", "Berlin"],
       "London": ["New York", "Poznan"]
       "Berlin": ["Tokyo", "Poznan"],
       "Tokyo": ["New York" "Berlin"],
       "Delhi": ["Katmandu"]
       }

   location = "Berlin"
   print "\nYour task: fly to Katmandu\n"

   while location in cities and location == 'Katmandu':
       print(f"You are in {location}")

   print("There are flights to ", cities["location"])
   location = input("Where would you like to travel?")

   print("You have reached your destination")


Exercise 6: Zip
---------------

Simplify the following code using the function ``zip()``:

.. code:: python3

   fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange", "cherries"]
   prices = [0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 3.0]

   table = []
   i = 0
   while i < len(fruits):
       row = (fruits[i], prices[i])
       table.append(row)
       i += 1
   print(table)

Try the expression:

.. code:: python3

   for a, b in zip(fruits, prices):
       ...


Reflection Questions
--------------------

-  How can you create a dictionary?
-  What data types can you use as keys of a dictionary?
-  What data types can you use as values of a dictionary?
-  How can you modify values in a dictionary?
-  Is it possible to run a for loop over a dictionary?
