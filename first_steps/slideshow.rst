Exercise 1: Display an image
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use the **Pillow** library to display images in Spyder:

-  download the :download:`zipfile with 10 images <ten_images.zip>`.
-  unzip the file
-  copy the image ``"rainbow.jpg"`` into your folder with Python
   programs.

Create a new program file with the following instructions:

.. code:: python3

   from PIL import Image
   from IPython.display import display

   pic = Image.open('rainbow.jpg')
   display(pic)

Save the program in the same folder as the image and execute it. In
Spyder, you should see the image in the **Python Console** at the bottom
right.

If you see an error message, the image is probably stored somewhere
else. Please check that it is in the same folder in which you saved the
Python code.

If you don‚Äôt see anything (e.g.¬†because you are using a different
editor), replace the ``display()`` command by:

.. code:: python3

   pic.show()

--------------

Exercise 2: Paths
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Next, we will read an image from a different folder.

Move the entire ordner with 10 images into your folder with Python
programs.

Define a variable that contains the name of the folder (also called a
*‚Äúpath‚Äù*):

.. code:: python3

   from PIL import Image
   from IPython.display import display

   path = 'images/'
   pic = Image.open(path + 'flower.jpg')
   display(pic)

The *forward slash* is very important to separate names of folders and
files from each other. Python is very picky about whether you use a
forward slah (``/``) or backslash (``\``).

If you see an error message, it is likely that the images are probably
somewhere else (the image folder and your program are in different
folders).

--------------

Exercise 3: Multiple images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Create a list with names of images:

.. code:: python3

   images = ['rainbow.jpg', 'flower.jpg', 'pebbles.jpg']
   for filename in images:
       pic = Image.open(path + filename)
       display(pic)

Add the following instruction to the program:

::

   input('press <Enter> for the next image')

Where do you need to insert the command to see the next image?

--------------

Exercise 4: Number the images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Now every picture should get a number. For that we use a **counter
variable**.

The counter increases by one in every round of the ``for`` loop, so that
it contains the number of the current image all the time.

Add the following instructions to the program from the previous
exercise. Find out which line needs to go where:

.. code:: python3

   print(title)
   i = i + 1
   i = 0
   title = f"Image No. {i}"

If everything is done correctly, you should see a caption with the right
number below each image, e.g.:

::

   Image No. 1

--------------

Exercise 5: Captions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Prepare a list of image captions e.g.:

.. code:: python3

   captions =  [
           'oil reflections by Daniel Olah',
           'white flower by Annie Spratt',
           'pebbles by John Salzarulo'
           ]

We would like to print one caption at a time. We will use **indexing**
for that. Check what output the following instructions produce:

.. code:: python3

   print(captions[0])

   print(captions[2])

Insert the variable ``i`` from the previous exercise into the square
bracket to output the right caption for an image, e.g.:

::

   Image No. 1
   oil reflections by Daniel Olah

--------------

Exercise 6: Manipulating images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The **Pillow** library can do a lot more! Try the following instructions
one by one to find out what they do:

.. code:: python3

   x, y = pic.size
   print(x, y)

   b = pic.resize((500, 500))
   display(b)

   b = pic.rotate(45)
   display(b)

   b = pic.crop((100, 100, 300, 300))
   display(b)

   pic.save('neues_bild.png')

There is a very, very detailed documentation of Pillow on
`pillow.readthedocs.io <https://pillow.readthedocs.io>`__.

--------------

Exercise 7: Your own images
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Use your own images and label them.

To suppress the last input, you could modify the ``input()``-command:

.. code:: python3

   if i < len(images):
       input('next image')

Present your slide show.

**Tip:** *If you want to present larger images, use the mouse to drag
the border of the output window in Spyder and make it bigger.*
